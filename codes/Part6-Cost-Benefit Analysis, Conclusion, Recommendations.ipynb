One can estimate the amount of losses the city will face from an incapacitated workforce. In 2017, there were 90 WNV cases, including 8 deaths ([CBS Chicago, 2019](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/08/29/west-nile-virus-death-reported-in-illinois/)).

    "\n",
    "— Use insect repellant that contains DEET, Picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus.  \n",
    "— Eliminate standing water weekly from sources including flowerpots, gutters, tires, toys, pet water dishes and birdbaths.  \n",
    "— Keep grass and weeds short to eliminate hiding places for adult mosquitoes.  \n",
    "— When outside between dusk and dawn, wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing, long pants, long-sleeved shirts, socks and shoes.  \n",
    "— Make sure all screens, windows and doors are tight fitting and free of holes. Repair or replace screens that have tears or other openings.  \n",
